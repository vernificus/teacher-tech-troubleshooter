# Teacher Tech Troubleshooter üßë‚Äçüè´üíª

**An application to help teachers quickly troubleshoot common classroom technology issues and find solutions.**

## About The Project

In today's classrooms, technology is essential, but it can also be a source of frustration when things go wrong. Teachers often need quick solutions to common tech problems to keep their lessons on track without lengthy delays waiting for IT support. This project aims to create a user-friendly application that empowers teachers to independently diagnose and resolve frequent technology issues they encounter with devices like projectors, laptops, tablets, smartboards, and common educational software.

Our goal is to provide clear, concise, and actionable troubleshooting steps, saving teachers valuable instruction time and reducing tech-related stress.

## Key Features (Planned)

* **Intuitive Issue Reporting:** Easily describe or select the problem you're facing.
* **Categorized Solutions:** Browse issues by device type (e.g., Projector, Laptop, Interactive Whiteboard, Tablet) or problem category (e.g., Connectivity, Audio/Visual, Software, Login).
* **Step-by-Step Guides:** Clear, easy-to-follow instructions with visuals (where appropriate) to guide teachers through solutions.
* **Search Functionality:** Quickly find solutions by typing keywords related to the issue.
* **Common Fixes First:** Prioritize the most common and simplest solutions.
* **Escalation Paths:** Provide guidance on when and how to escalate issues to dedicated IT support if the app's solutions don't resolve the problem.
* **(Potentially) Community Contributions:** Allow teachers to suggest new problems and solutions (moderated).
