# Teacher Tech Troubleshooter üßë‚Äçüè´üíª

**An application to help teachers quickly troubleshoot common classroom technology issues and find solutions.**

## About The Project

In today's classrooms, technology is essential, but it can also be a source of frustration when things go wrong. Teachers often need quick solutions to common tech problems to keep their lessons on track without lengthy delays waiting for IT support. This project aims to create a user-friendly application that empowers teachers to independently diagnose and resolve frequent technology issues they encounter with devices like projectors, laptops, tablets, smartboards, and common educational software.

Our goal is to provide clear, concise, and actionable troubleshooting steps, saving teachers valuable instruction time and reducing tech-related stress.

## Key Features (Planned)

* **Intuitive Issue Reporting:** Easily describe or select the problem you're facing.
* **Categorized Solutions:** Browse issues by device type (e.g., Projector, Laptop, Interactive Whiteboard, Tablet) or problem category (e.g., Connectivity, Audio/Visual, Software, Login).
* **Step-by-Step Guides:** Clear, easy-to-follow instructions with visuals (where appropriate) to guide teachers through solutions.
* **Search Functionality:** Quickly find solutions by typing keywords related to the issue.
* **Common Fixes First:** Prioritize the most common and simplest solutions.
* **Escalation Paths:** Provide guidance on when and how to escalate issues to dedicated IT support if the app's solutions don't resolve the problem.
* **(Potentially) Community Contributions:** Allow teachers to suggest new problems and solutions (moderated).

## Getting Started

_Instructions on how to set up, install, and use the application will be added here once the project is further along in development._

For now, this repository contains the initial planning and (soon) the codebase for the Teacher Tech Troubleshooter.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to make this tool as helpful as possible for teachers! Whether it's reporting a common issue, suggesting a solution, or helping with development, your input is valuable.

_Detailed contribution guidelines will be added soon. In the meantime, feel free to open an "Issue" to share ideas or problems._
